# Hivelocal HK

This web application serves as an information hub for various facilities in Hong Kong. Initially designed to track the movement of limited coin carts across areas, it features a dashboard that simplifies viewing their schedules. This webapp added a map interface to further enhance usability ([Match Between the System and the Real World](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/#toc-2-match-between-the-system-and-the-real-world-2)).

> [!NOTE]
> This application may change to add more facilities as long as APIs are available. However, this application mainly focuses on those that don't show on commonly used map applications.
